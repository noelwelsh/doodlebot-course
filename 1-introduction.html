    # Doodlebot Case Study

    ???

    **Estimated time: 15 minutes**

    Notes help:

    - "You" generally means the trainer.
    - Trainees are referred to as "the trainees".
    - Direct questions/comments for the trainees are written in italics.
      For example, *What are your goals for the course?*
      means your should ask the trainees what their goals are.
    - An ellipsis at the end of the notes indicates
      you can use the transition to the next slide for effect.

    Keyboard help:

    - Pressing P toggled speaker view.
    - Pressing C clones the slideshow view (to put on the projector if you're using speaker view).
    - Pressing ? toggles keyboard commands help.

    # Introduction

    ???

    ---

    # Doodlebot

    - A simple chat application.
    - See the Essential Scala patterns in a larger context
    - See an example closer to most people's day job

    ???

    The goal here is to show how the Essential Scala patterns transfer out of the classroom.
    We'll use a fairly small web application, with a front- and back-end both written in Scala.
    We first see the working web application, then fix a broken version of the back-end.

    ---

    # Getting Started

    - Fork `https://github.com/underscoreio/doodlebot`
    - Run it as described in the `README`

    ???

    ---

    # Explore

    - Try the signup and login actions
    - Make sure you explore the error behavior

    ???

    We'll be reimplementing signup and login, so make sure you understand how
    they work, and in particular the error behavior:

    - requirements for user names and passwords
    - duplicate signups
    - login when the user doesn't exist
    - login when the password is incorrect

    ---

    # Break Everything!

    Switch to the `broken` branch.
