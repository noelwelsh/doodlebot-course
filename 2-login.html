    # Fixing Login

    - Login is broken
    - Always claims there is no user with the given name
    - Let's fix this

    ???

    Get the students to verify this with their copy, to ensure they are on the correct branch.

    # Login, Conceptually

    *Before we get into the code*
    - What are the possible responses we can get back from our login endpoint?
    - What pattern does this use?

    ???

    The students should realise the result can be success or failure, and
    ideally that failure can be either
    - user does not exist; or
    - the password is incorrect.

    They should recognise the algebraic data type pattern, but they are likely
    to confuse levels and talk about sealed traits etc., which is how we
    implement algebraic data types in Scala.

    # `Xor[Error, Success]`

    - `error.left[Success]` and `success.right[Failure]`
    - `Xor.fromOption(option, ifNone)`
    - What sequencing methods do you expect on `Xor`. What do they do?

    ???

    Cats has a type to represent a logical or: `Xor`. By convention the left
    hand side represents a failure, and right is right. So `Xor` is appropriate
    when you want to represent a logical or AND one of the types is some notion
    of failure.

    Explain how to construct an `Xor` from input. You can use the `sbt` console
    to show examples.

    We expect `flatMap`, and `map`, and `fold`. Go through the meaning of these,
    using diagrams where appropriate. Show how one side of the `Xor` encodes a failure.

    # `login` method

    We have

    ~~~ scala
    final case class Login(name: Name, password: Password)
    ~~~

    Our `login` method will accept a `Login`. What should the result type
    for `login` be?

    ???

    We looking for the students to recognise that the different errors case
    should be represented by a common type (i.e. form an algebraic data type)
    Call this `LoginError `. We're then want to return `Xor[LoginError,
    Session]`

    ---

    # `login` internals

    The control flow (ignoring errors) for login is:

    1. Get the account for the given name
    2. Check the password is correct
    3. Create a session

    ---

    # `login` internals

    1. Get the account for the given name
    2. Check the password is correct

    Each of these steps can fail. How should we sequence them?

    ???

    `flatMap` that shit.

    ---

    # `login` internals

    Doodlebot stores all data in-memory
    - `accounts: Map[Name, User]`
    - `makeSession(name: Name): Session`

    Open `store.scala` and implement `login` correctly.

    ---

    # `login`

    ~~~ scala
    def login(login: Login): Xor[LoginError,Session] = {
      Store.synchronized {
        for {
          user <- Xor.fromOption(accounts.get(login.name),
                                 nameDoesNotExist(login.name))
          session <- if(user.password == login.password)
                       makeSession(login.name).right
                     else
                       passwordIncorrect.left
        } yield session
      }
    }
